# Parts List

If you already do stuff with electronics you probably have many of the parts sitting around.  Below is a parts list optimized for someone who maybe just has a soldering iron but wants to mostly plug and play.  In multiple cases below you have to buy multiple pieces so this artificially inflates the cost.

$20 [Particle Photon (WiFi)](https://store.particle.io/collections/wifi/products/photon) (buy with headers so you can plug into a breadboard)

$10 [Small breadboard](https://www.amazon.com/DEYUE-breadboard-Set-Prototype-Board/dp/B07LFD4LT6/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=small+breadboard&qid=1602615796&sr=8-3) (they are very cheap but not sold individually so you would typically buy a handful)

(you might also consider a [kit like this](https://www.verical.com/pd/particle-industries-----misc-kits-and-tools-photonkit-3439409) that includes Photon and breadboard)

$9 [OneWire Temperature Sensor](https://www.amazon.com/DS18B20-Temperature-Waterproof-Stainless-Raspberry/dp/B087JQ6MCP/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=ds18b20&qid=1602616146&sr=8-3) - this one includes a little breakout board with the pull-up resistor so is an easy on ramp.  The sensors themselves are cheap
but they are typically [not sold individually](https://www.amazon.com/Gikfun-DS18B20-Temperature-Waterproof-EK1083x3/dp/B012C597T0/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=ds18b20&qid=1602363368&sr=8-5). 

$16 Hall Effect current sensor- [ModernDevice](https://moderndevice.com/product/current-sensor/). This comes with a male header and it's a bit of a pain in that you have to create a longer wire to connect to the Photon.

$6 3.3v power supply if your furnace has an outlet that only activates when the fan is on (saving you having to build a step-down circuit or use a voltage regulator).
