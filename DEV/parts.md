# Parts List

If you already do stuff with electronics you probably have many of the parts sitting around.
Below is a parts list optimized for someone who maybe just has a soldering iron but wants to
mostly plug and play.  In multiple cases below you have to buy multiple pieces so this
artificially inflates the cost. (I really really miss Radio Shack)

$20 [Particle Photon (WiFi)](https://store.particle.io/collections/wifi/products/photon)
(buy with headers so you can plug into a breadboard)

$10 [Small breadboard](https://www.amazon.com/DEYUE-breadboard-Set-Prototype-Board/dp/B07LFD4LT6/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=small+breadboard&qid=1602615796&sr=8-3)
(they are actually about $1-2 but not sold individually so you would typically buy a handful)

For the above, you might also consider a [kit like this](https://www.verical.com/pd/particle-industries-----misc-kits-and-tools-photonkit-3439409) that includes Photon and breadboard)

$9 [OneWire Temperature Sensor](https://www.amazon.com/DS18B20-Temperature-Waterproof-Stainless-Raspberry/dp/B087JQ6MCP/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=ds18b20&qid=1602616146&sr=8-3) - this one includes a little breakout board with the pull-up resistor so is an easy on ramp.  The sensors themselves are $2-3 (cheaper for just the sensor without the wire or waterproof packaging) 
but they are typically [not sold individually](https://www.amazon.com/Gikfun-DS18B20-Temperature-Waterproof-EK1083x3/dp/B012C597T0/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=ds18b20&qid=1602363368&sr=8-5). 

$16 Hall Effect current sensor- [ModernDevice](https://moderndevice.com/product/current-sensor/). This comes with a male header and it's a bit of a pain in that you have to create a longer wire to connect to the Photon. This is pretty expensive as sensor but it's convenient.

$6 [3.3v power supply](https://www.amazon.com/3-3V-Adapter-Power-5-5-2-1/dp/B07BGW2VXV/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=3.3v+power+supply&qid=1602616592&sr=8-3) if your furnace has an outlet that only activates when the fan is on (saving you having to build a step-down circuit or use a voltage regulator).
